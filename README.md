# SimpleCiphers
A Python program that uses a Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt statements.

- In cipher_program.py change DECK_FILENAME to ‘deck1.txt’ or ‘deck2.txt’ to choose which encrptyion or decryption deck/method to use.
- Change MSG_FILENAME to ‘secret1.txt’, ‘secret2.txt’, ‘secret3.txt’, ‘secret4.txt’, ‘secret5.txt’, ‘secret6.txt’, ‘secret7.txt’ and ‘message_file1.txt’ to choose which file to encrypt/decrypt. Files that start with secret are decryption files while files that start with message_file are encryption files.
- Change MODE to ‘e’ or ‘d’ to encrypt or decrypt a file.
- Run cipher_program.py to view the encrypted or decrypted message.
